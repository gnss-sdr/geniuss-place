**This page is the "_Hello, world!_&nbsp;" for GNSS-SDR**. It will guide you
from the scratch up to getting position fixes with GNSS-SDR, in one of its
simplest configurations. The signal source will be a file (freely available on
the Internet) containing raw signal samples, so this procedure does not require
the availability of a radio frequency front-end nor a powerful computer
executing the software receiver. The only requirement is GNSS-SDR installed in
your computer, and an Internet connection to download the file containing the
raw signal samples.
{: .notice--info}

## Step 1: Verify that GNSS-SDR is installed

This guide assumes that GNSS-SDR and its software dependencies are already
installed on your system. In order to check whether it is correctly installed,
open a terminal and type:

```console
$ gnss-sdr --version
```

you should see something similar to:

```console
$ gnss-sdr --version
gnss-sdr version 0.0.20
$  
```
{: class="no-copy"}

Please check that your installed version is 0.0.20 (or something like
0.0.20.git-`branchname`-`githash` if you built the code from a source code
snapshot). Older versions could not work for the example shown here. If you
installed GNSS-SDR by doing `sudo apt install gnss-sdr` and you got a
version earlier to 0.0.20, please do `sudo apt remove gnss-sdr` and [build
it from source]({{ "/build-and-install/#build" | relative_url }}).
{: .notice--warning}

If you see something like:

```console
$ gnss-sdr --version
gnss-sdr: command not found
$  
```
{: class="no-copy"}

please check out the [building guide]({{ "/build-and-install/" | relative_url }})
and the [README.md](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/README.md)
file for more details on how to install GNSS-SDR.

In order to take advantage of the SIMD instruction sets present in your
processor, you will need to run the profiler tools of the VOLK and VOLK_GNSSSDR
libraries (these operations only need to be done once, and can take a while):

```console
$ volk_profile
```

and

```console
$ volk_gnsssdr_profile
```

## Step 2: Download a file of raw signal samples

Now it's time to download the file containing the GNSS raw signal samples. This
can be done directly from the terminal:

```console
$ mkdir work
$ cd work
$ wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnss-sdr/files/data/2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf 2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.tar.gz
```

or by opening [this
link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnss-sdr/files/data/2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.tar.gz/download)
in your browser, downloading the file, and unpacking it. This will get you the
file `2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.dat`, which contains $$ 100 $$
seconds of raw GNSS signal samples collected by an RF front-end centered at
$$ 1,575.42 $$ MHz, that was delivering baseband samples at $$ 4 $$ MS/s, in an
interleaved I&Q 16-bit integer format.


## Step 3: Configure GNSS-SDR

Then, copy the GNSS-SDR configuration shown below and paste it into your
favorite plain text editor:

{: .notice--warning}

**NOTE:** For more details about the configuration options for each block,
check out the [**Signal Processing Blocks**]({{ "/docs/sp-blocks/" |
relative_url }}) documentation.
{: .notice--info}

Save the file as `my-first-GNSS-SDR-receiver.conf` (or any other name of your
choice).

## Step 4: Run GNSS-SDR

Ok, let's recap. We have:

* GNSS-SDR installed in our system.
* A signal source: A file named `2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.dat`
containing 100 seconds of raw GPS signal samples, that were grabbed by a radio
frequency front-end.
* A configuration file for a GPS L1 C/A receiver that will take the file `2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.dat` as its signal source.

So, we are ready to run our software-defined GPS receiver. In a terminal, type:

```console
$ gnss-sdr --config_file=./my-first-GNSS-SDR-receiver.conf
```

**NOTE:** Change `./my-first-GNSS-receiver.conf` by the actual name and path of
your recently created configuration file.
{: .notice--warning}

You should see something similar to:

```
$ gnss-sdr --config_file=./my-first-GNSS-SDR-receiver.conf
