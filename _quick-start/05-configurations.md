Obtaining position fixes from a file is nice and useful, but the real deal for a
software-defined receiver is to play with live GNSS signals in real-time. This
page describes examples of hardware setups, software configurations, and general
tips for obtaining position fixes (and a collection of side data, delivered in
standard formats) with GNSS-SDR.


**Important note:** Either if you are capturing signal in a file for
post-processing, or if you are configuring a receiver to work in real-time with
live signal samples delivered by a radio frequency front-end, **you will need an
active antenna** (that is, an antenna with an integrated low noise amplifier
delivering a gain in the band of interest greater than $$ 20 $$ dB, with a noise
figure below $$ 2 $$ dB), **and you will need to feed it**.
{: .notice--warning}

Some radio frequency front-ends have jumpers, or some other configurable mode,
for antenna feeding. If this feature is not available, you will need a bias-T in
the antenna cable or some other kind of protection in order to inject power to
the antenna without harming the front-end, plus an adequate power source (GNSS
antennas use to be fed in a range from 2.5 VDC to 5.5 VDC, please check your
model's datasheet).

## GPS L1 C/A receiver using a USRP

This is an example of an eight-channel GPS L1 C/A receiver, working at 4 MS/s
(baseband, _i.e._ complex samples), and using a device from the [USRP
family](https://www.ettus.com/products/) as the "air-to-computer" interface.

### Required equipment

In order to get real-time position fixes, you will need:

  * **An active GPS antenna**. Any model will fit, just check that you can plug
  it to the USRP's SMA-male connector.

  * **A USRP**. All models will do the job. Depending on the specific USRP
  model you are using, the configuration may vary (see below).

  _Some USRP models and features. The ADC processing bandwidth is the sample
  rate provided by the ADCs on the USRP motherboard, and the host sample rate
  refers to the sample stream between the FPGA of a USRP device, and a host PC.
  Some USRP models also provide the option to stream 8-bit samples, effectively
  doubling the host-bandwidth in terms of samples/second. Source: [Ettus

  * The USRP family features a modular architecture with interchangeable
  daughterboard modules that serve as the RF front end. In the case of using a
  USRP without an embedded transceiver, you will need **a daughterboard**
  allowing the reception of signals around 1.5 GHz. That is: DBSRX2, WBX, SBX,
  CBX, and UBX daughterboards can work for you. You will not need a
  daughterboard if you are using USRP B200, B210, or E310, which ship an Analog
  Devices AD9361 RFIC as an integrated wideband transceiver.

  * **A computer** connected to the USRP and with GNSS-SDR installed.

### Setting up the front-end

The first thing to do is to install a suitable daughterboard into the USRP. As
an example, you can check Ettus Research's detailed [step-by-step guide to
install a daughterboard into the USRP
N200/N210](https://kb.ettus.com/USRP_N_Series_Quick_Start_(Daughterboard_Installation)).
In USRPs with two receiving slots, please check in which one you are inserting
the daughterboard (they are usually labeled as "RX A" and "RX B"). This is
something that you will need to specify in the configuration file (via the
`subdevice` parameter, see below).

Then, you will need to feed your GNSS active antenna.

**Important:** Never apply more than -15 dBm of power into any RF input.
{: .notice--danger}

In the case of using a DBSRX2 daughterboard, you will need to adjust the J101
jumper in order to feed the antenna.

injection of current towards the antenna. Source: [Radio
Adventures](https://yo3iiu.ro/blog/)._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

If this feature is not available (_e.g._, WBX daughterboards), you will need a
bias-T between the USRP and the antenna, and to connect it to a power source
delivering the voltage required by your antenna (usually, 3 V or 5 V).

Depending on the specific USRP model you are using, the connection to the host
computer in charge of the execution of the software receiver can be through USB
(2.0 or 3.0) or Ethernet (1 GigE or 10 GigE). Once connected, every USRP device
has [several ways of identifying
it](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_identification.html) on the host system:

|----------
| **Identifier** | **Key**  | **Notes**                      | **Example**                   |
| :------------- | :------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| -------------- |
| Serial #       | `serial` | globally unique identifier     | 12345678                      |
| IP Address     | `addr`   | unique identifier on a network | 192.168.10.2                  |
| Type           | `type`   | hardware series identifier     | usrp1, usrp2, b200, x300, ... |
| Name           | `name`   | optional user-set identifier   | lab1_usrp3                    |
| -------------- |

 _Common device identifiers. Source: [Identifying USRP Devices](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_identification.html)._
 {: style="text-align: center;"}

Devices attached to your system can be discovered using the `uhd_find_devices`
program. This program scans your system for supported devices and prints out an
enumerated list of discovered devices and their addresses. If you type
`uhd_find_devices --help` in a terminal, you should see something similar to
this:

```console
$ uhd_find_devices --help
linux; GNU C++ version 4.9.2; Boost_105400; UHD_003.010.git-0-2d68f228

UHD Find Devices Allowed options:
  --help                help message
  --args arg            device address args
```
{: class="no-copy"}

Then, you can search your USRP in a specific IP address:

```console
$ uhd_find_devices --args addr=192.168.50.2
linux; GNU C++ version 4.9.2; Boost_105400; UHD_003.010.git-0-2d68f228

--------------------------------------------------
-- UHD Device 0
--------------------------------------------------
Device Address:
    type: x300
    addr: 192.168.50.2
    fpga: HGS
    name:
    serial: F5CA38
    product: X300
```
{: class="no-copy"}

or by typing:

```console
$ uhd_find_devices --args type=usrp1
```

This is a good way to check if the USRP is correctly connected to your computer.
After this check, we can proceed to configure the software receiver. The [USRP
Hardware Driver and USRP
Manual](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_devices.html) provides more
information about the configuration and usage of those devices.

### Setting up the software receiver

Copy the configuration below into your favorite plain text editor and save it
with a name such as `my_GPS_receiver.conf` in your working directory.

You will need to adjust the values for at least two parameters:

  * Check that `SignalSource.device_address` points to the actual IP address of
  your USRP, if you are connected through Ethernet, or leave it empty for USB.
  * Check that `SignalSource.subdevice` is set to the receiving slot in which
  you actually inserted your daughterboard with the antenna. In USRPs with only
  one receiving slot, leave it as `A:0`. Please check more details on [how to
  specify the
  subdevice](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_configuration.html#config_subdev).

The [Signal Processing Blocks documentation]({{ "/docs/sp-blocks/" |
relative_url }}) provides definitions and more details about the configuration
parameters.

### Run it!

Once the hardware and the software configurations are ready, go to your favorite
working directory where the file `my_GPS_receiver.conf` was stored and invoke
the software receiver with this particular configuration:

```console
$ gnss-sdr --config_file=./my_GPS_receiver.conf
```

You should see something similar to:

```console

### If something goes wrong

* Check out that the GNSS antenna is actually fed and that it is placed in a
location with good sky visibility.

* Check out Ettus Research's [getting starting
guide](https://kb.ettus.com/Getting_Started_Guides) for your particular hardware
configuration.

* Watch out for overflows! Maybe your host computer is not able to sustain the
required computational load for this particular implementation.

{% capture overflow-text %}
 When receiving, the USRP device produces samples at a constant rate. Overflows
 occur when the host computer does not consume data fast enough. When UHD
 software detects the overflow, it prints an "`O`" or "`D`" to the standard
 terminal output and pushes an inline message packet into the receive stream.

  * **Network-based devices (_e.g._, USRP N2xx, X3xx)**: The host does not
  back-pressure the receive stream. When the kernel's socket buffer becomes
  full, it will drop subsequent packets. UHD software detects the overflow as a
  discontinuity in the packet's sequence numbers and pushes an inline message
  packet into the receive stream. In this case, the character `D` is printed to
  the standard terminal output as an indication.
  * **Other devices (_e.g._, USRP 1, B2xx)**: The host back-pressures the
  receive stream. Therefore, overflows always occur in the device itself. When
  the device's internal buffers become full, streaming is shut off, and an
  inline message packet is sent to the host. In this case, the character "`O`"
  is printed to the standard terminal output as an indication. If the device was
  in continuous streaming mode, the UHD software will automatically restart
  streaming when the buffer has space again.

## GPS L1 C/A receiver using a HackRF One

[HackRF One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) from Great Scott Gadgets is
an [open-source](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf) Software Defined
Radio peripheral capable of reception of radio signals from 1 MHz to 6 GHz, and
thus is well suited for GNSS applications. If features:

  * Up to 20 million samples per second.
  * 8-bit quadrature samples (8-bit I and 8-bit Q).
  * Software-configurable RX gain and baseband filter.
  * Software-controlled antenna port power (50 mA at 3.3 V).
  * SMA female antenna connector.
  * SMA female clock input and output for synchronization.
  * Hi-Speed USB 2.0.
  * USB-powered.

For more information, check out the [HackRF
documentation](https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Required equipment

In order to get real-time position fixes, you will need:

  * **An active GPS antenna**. Most models will fit, just check that you can
  plug it to the HackRF's SMA-female connector, and that 50 mA at 3.3 V is an
  adequate feeding.
  * **A HackRF One**.
  * **A stable clock**: the oscillator shipped with the HackRF is not good
  enough for GNSS signal processing. You will need a frequency stability of 1
  ppm or better.
  * **A computer** connected to the HackRF One and with GNSS-SDR installed.


This device requires the use of the [`Osmosdr_Signal_Source`]({{
"/docs/sp-blocks/signal-source/#implementation-osmosdr_signal_source" |
relative_url }}) implementation. If you installed GNSS-SDR from a software
package, this implementation is already available. But if you are building
GNSS-SDR from the source code, you will need the required software dependencies
(the `gr-osmosdr` component of GNU Radio) and configure the building with the
following flag:

```console
$ cmake -DENABLE_OSMOSDR=ON ../
```

and then build and install the software:

```console
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

For more information, check out the tutorial about [GNSS-SDR options at building
time]({{ "/docs/tutorials/configuration-options-building-time/" | relative_url }}).

### Setting up the front-end

Once the software is ready, connect your HackRF to your computer, and connect
the active antenna. In order to activate the antenna feeding, the configuration
file must use the [`Osmosdr_Signal_Source`]({{
"/docs/sp-blocks/signal-source/#implementation-osmosdr_signal_source" |
relative_url }}) implementation and include the following line:

```ini
SignalSource.osmosdr_args=hackrf,bias=1
```

You will need to provide an external clock source to the HackRF with a frequency
stability of 1 ppm or better (so a 10 MHz oscillator will vary by 10 Hz).

### Setting up the software receiver

A possible configuration file could be:


```ini

Copy and paste this configuration in your favorite plain text editor and save it
as, for instance, `hackrf_GPS_L1.conf`.

Once the hardware and the software configurations are ready, go to your favorite
working directory where the file `hackrf_GPS_L1.conf` was stored and invoke the
software receiver with this particular configuration:

```console
$ gnss-sdr --config_file=./hackrf_GPS_L1.conf
```

You should see something similar to the example [above](#run-it).

### HackRF and GNSS-SDR in action
