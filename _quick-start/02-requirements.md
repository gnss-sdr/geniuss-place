In order to execute GNSS-SDR, you will need:


 1. A computing platform with some software dependencies installed.
 2. A GNSS signal source:
   - can be a file storing GNSS signal samples,
   - or a suitable radio frequency front-end, if you want to operate in
   real-time.


## The computing platform

### Processor architecture

GNSS-SDR can be built in a variety of processor architectures, covering a wide
range of computers such as desktops, laptops, minicomputers, embedded systems,
and even mainframes:

* Intel/AMD [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) instruction set (32 and 64
bits).
* [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC): big-endian and
little-endian, 32 and 64 bits.
* [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture): version v4t and above,
including 64-bit ARMv8.
* [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set): big-endian and
little-endian, 32 and 64 bits.
* [IBM System z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z): IBM's
architecture for mainframe computers.

GNSS-SDR will process incoming raw samples as fast as the computing platform
executing it allows. It will automatically take advantage of multi-core
architectures, and it will select the fastest SIMD implementation available in
your machine (covering technologies such as
[SSE2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#techs=SSE2),
[SSE3](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#techs=SSE3),
[SSE4.1](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#techs=SSE4_1),
[AVX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#techs=AVX),
[AVX2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#techs=AVX2),
and [NEON](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Neon)). It can even offload
some of the computing work to the Graphics Processing Unit. If there is
computational power enough, GNSS-SDR can be used in real-time, reading raw
samples from a radio frequency front-end. In slower machines, GNSS-SDR will
execute exactly the same code, for instance reading raw samples from a file
stored in a hard drive.


**Try the software on your own computer**: GNSS-SDR can be executed in a wide
range of processor architectures, from the newest ones to those that have been
around for a while. Your own computer will probably be among the listed above.
The software receiver processes data _as fast as it can_, taking advantage of
the particularities of your processor and dumping messages to the terminal
output in case it is not able to perform the required computation in real-time.
If your processor is not fast enough to process GNSS signals in real-time, you
can still use files and use the software, performing exactly the same processing
but at a slower pace, and thus without processing time constraints.

### Operating Systems

GNSS-SDR can be run on a variety of operating systems:

* ![GNU/Linux Logo]({{ "/assets/images/tux.png" | relative_url
}}){:height="100px" width="100px"}{: .align-right} **GNU/Linux**: GNSS-SDR and
all its dependencies can be easily installed in most popular distributions, and
it is even included as a software package starting in [Debian 9
(stretch)](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/gnss-sdr) and [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
(Xenial)](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=gnss-sdr). Older releases
and other distributions might also work well.
* ![Mac OS Logo]({{ "/assets/images/macos-logo.png" | relative_url
}}){:height="100px" width="100px"}{: .align-right} **macOS / Mac OS X**:
GNSS-SDR and all its dependencies can be easily installed using Mac OS X 10.9
(Mavericks) and above, including macOS 11 Big Sur. You will need
[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and a software package manager such
as [Macports](https://www.macports.org/) (there is a [gnss-sdr
port](https://ports.macports.org/search/?q=gnss-sdr&name=on ) that will do
all the work for you) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
* ![Windows Logo]({{ "/assets/images/logo-windows.png" | relative_url
}}){:height="100px" width="100px"}{: .align-right} **Microsoft Windows**: At
this time of writing, GNSS-SDR cannot be built natively on Microsoft Windows. As
far as authors' knowledge, nothing prevents it but their own ignorance on
Microsoft's building tools. Users have reported successful buildings of GNU
Radio on Windows systems, so there should be not serious caveats building
GNSS-SDR as well. However, GNSS-SDR is not blocked for Windows users. There are
several virtualization tools that work well. Here we suggest Oracle's
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), a professional solution that can be
installed on Windows XP and later and it is freely available as Open Source
Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.
Users can install VirtualBox on their Windows machine, and then install the
ultimate Linux version as a _guest_ operating system. Another possibility is to
run GNSS-SDR as a [Docker
container](https://github.com/carlesfernandez/docker-gnsssdr).


**The Operating System should not be an issue**: GNSS-SDR can be executed in
GNU/Linux distributions as old as Ubuntu  14.04 LTS, and even in Mac OS X
starting from 10.9. You are probably already working with newer versions, or you
can install a virtual machine running the ultimate Ubuntu or Debian releases.

### Software dependencies

GNSS-SDR builds upon a number of free and open-source software libraries:

* [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/), a free and open-source toolkit for
software radio. In turn, GNU Radio requires a number of software dependencies,
some of which are also used by GNSS-SDR. Notably,
[Boost](https://www.boost.org/), [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/) and
[VOLK](https://www.libvolk.org/).
* [Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.net/), a C++ linear algebra library. It
acts as a wrapper for all the relevant libraries present on your system, such as
[LAPACK](https://www.netlib.org/lapack/), [BLAS](https://www.netlib.org/blas/),
[OpenBlas](https://www.openblas.net/),
[ATLAS](https://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/), and
[others](https://arma.sourceforge.net/faq.html#linking).
* [glog](https://github.com/google/glog), a C++ implementation of the Google
logging module.
* [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags), a C++ library that implements
command-line flags processing.
* [matio](https://github.com/tbeu/matio), a MATLAB MAT file I/O library.
* [PugiXML](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml), a light-weight, simple and fast
XML parser for C++.
* [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/), Google's
language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing
structured data.
* A library implementing some basic SSL functions, such as
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), [GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org/), or
[LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org/).

In order to install those dependencies in your system, check out our [building
guide]({{ "/build-and-install/" | relative_url }}) and find more details at
GNSS-SDR's
[README.md](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/README.md) file.

**Availability of automated tools**: Building and installing GNSS-SDR and its
dependencies is a quite complex process, but there are automated tools that can
do most of the work for you. Check out our [**building guide**]({{
"/build-and-install/" | relative_url }}).

## GNSS Signal Sources

The input of GNSS-SDR is a sequence of raw digital samples of GNSS signals. The
_Signal Source_ abstraction wraps _all_ kind of sources, regardless of their
nature: it can be a file containing a sequence of samples (which can be
synthetically generated by a computer program, or real GNSS signals grabbed by
an actual antenna and radio frequency front-end, and then translated into the
digital domain and stored in a hard disk), or an actual device delivering live
signal in real-time. In GNSS-SDR, whatever source delivering GNSS signal samples
is a _Signal Source_.

For more details about the configuration and possible options, please check out
the [**Signal Source documentation**]({{ "/docs/sp-blocks/signal-source/" |
relative_url }}).
{: .notice--info}

### Files

The stream of raw GNSS signal samples can be stored in a file. Some of such
files are freely available on the Internet, so you do not need access to a GNSS
front-end for using GNSS-SDR. Only a few basic parameters are needed to be known
(file name and path, the sampling frequency, the format in which samples are
delivered, the presence of an Intermediate Frequency) in order to configure
GNSS-SDR's _Signal Source_ adequately.

GNSS-SDR consumes data _as fast as it can_, regardless of the original sample
rate in which the signal was captured. Hence, the processing of a file
containing captured samples can take less time than the actual recording length.

On the contrary, in multi-system, multi-band configurations using a high number
of parallel channels or highly complex algorithms, the host computer could not
be able to perform the required processing in due time. While this is an issue
in real-time configurations (that would cause buffer overflows and service
discontinuity), it is not a problem when processing samples from a file. The
software receiver will process samples at its own pace, applying exactly the
same processing as it were real-time, and delivering the corresponding outputs
as soon as they are available. This is very useful for algorithm prototyping
since its functional performance can be checked before code optimization and
does not require a powerful computer.

### Radio frequency front-ends

For real-time operation with live GNSS signals, you will need an
"air-to-computer" interface. That is, a suitable antenna and some hardware
providing signal amplification at the appropriate frequency ranges (see our
[GNSS Signals tutorial]({{ "/docs/tutorials/gnss-signals/" | relative_url }})
for more information about GNSS signals' center frequencies, modulations, and
recommended bandwidths), downshifting, filtering, and conversion to the digital
domain, plus some standard connection (usually, through USB or Ethernet) to the
host computer in charge of the execution of the software-defined receiver, which
will be performing all the baseband processing. Such a computer needs to be
powerful enough to sustain the required amount of computational load. For simple
configurations, any modern laptop should work well.

It follows a non-exhaustive list of commercially available examples of such
general-purpose "air-to-computer" interfaces that are suitable for
software-defined GNSS receivers:

* **Ettus Research [USRP family](https://www.ettus.com/products/)** is designed
for RF applications from DC to 6 GHz, and provides a wide range of devices. The
USRP product line spans from affordable hobbyist SDRs to high-end high-bandwidth
radios. All USRPs can be used by GNSS-SDR through the USRP Hardware Driver
([UHD](https://files.ettus.com/manual/)).

* **Fairwaves [UmTRX](https://osmocom.org/projects/umtrx/wiki/UmTRX)** is an
open hardware dual-channel wideband transceiver that covers from 300 MHz to 3.8
GHz with a maximum RF bandwidth of 28 MHz, delivering 12-bit quadrature samples
up to 40 MS/s, and it is able to operate at industrial temperature ranges. Host
connection is via Gigabit Ethernet, and a special version of UHD provides a host
driver, along with the firmware.

* **Great Scott Gadgets [HackRF One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/)**
is an open-source hardware platform for Software Defined Radio that can operate
from 1 MHz to 6 GHz, with a maximum quadrature sample rate of 20 MS/s with 8-bit
quadrature samples (8-bit I and 8-bit Q). It features a software-controlled port
to feed an active antenna and a Hi-Speed USB 2.0 connection. GNSS-SDR
integration is provided via
[gr-osmosdr](https://osmocom.org/projects/gr-osmosdr/wiki/GrOsmoSDR).

* **Nuand [BladeRF](https://www.nuand.com/)** is a wideband transceiver that covers
from 300 MHz to 3.8 GHz, delivering 12-bit quadrature sampling at a rate of up to
40 MS/s. The host connection is via USB 3.0 Superspeed, and GNSS-SDR integration
is provided via
[gr-osmosdr](https://osmocom.org/projects/gr-osmosdr/wiki/GrOsmoSDR).

For testing purposes, the antenna can be replaced by a radio frequency GNSS
signal generator, which can directly feed the front-end and thus provide
controlled inputs to the software-defined receiver. In such a case, you might
need an attenuator between the signal generator and the antenna input in order
to protect the RF circuitry.
