This project has been mainly developed on a volunteer basis, for education and
research purposes. The main [Developer Team]({{ "/team/" | relative_url }}) is a
group of researchers at [CTTC](https://www.cttc.cat/), a non-profit research
institution, and the project enjoys from a solid base of external users and
contributors.

Slowly but steadily baked, the source code evolved and demonstrated its
feasibility as an open and free framework for software-defined GNSS receiver
development, attracting the interest of [more researchers]({{ "/publications/" |
relative_url }}), students, skilled hobbyists, and the industry.

According to [Black Duck Open Hub](https://openhub.net/p/gnss-sdr), the
development of GNSS-SDR from its [first
commit](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/commit/228fa3b797dba7d0192f751e7e25a7b8348f9326)
to a Git repository (in October 2011, after a happy childhood living in a
Subversion repository) up to now has taken 77 years of effort, as estimated by
the Constructive Cost Model ([COCOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO)).
