As a matter of fact, GNSS baseband signal processing requires a high
computational load. Even in modern computers, real-time processing is hard to
reach without a proper software architecture able to make the most of the
processor(s) that are executing it. It is then of the utmost importance to
exploit the underlying parallelisms in the processing platform executing the
software receiver in order to meet real-time requirements.

A fundamental model of architectural parallelism is found in shared-memory
parallel computers, which can work on several tasks at once, simply by parceling
them out to the different processors, by executing multiple instruction streams
in an interleaved way in a single processor (an approach known as simultaneous
multithreading, or SMT), or by a combination of both strategies. SMT platforms,
multicore machines, and shared-memory parallel computers all provide system
support for the execution of multiple independent instruction streams, or
_threads_. This approach is referred to as _task parallelism_, and it is well
supported by the main programming languages, compilers, and operating systems.
To make this potential performance gain effective, the software running on the
platform must be written in such a way that it can spread its workload across
multiple execution cores. Applications and operating systems that are written to
support this feature are referred to as _multi-threaded_. When programmed with
the appropriate design, execution can be accelerated almost linearly with the
number of processing cores.

Hereafter, we describe the key underlying concepts and the software design on
which GNSS-SDR is built upon.

## A model for software-defined radios

Task parallelization focuses on distributing execution processes (threads)
across different parallel computing nodes (processors), each executing a
different thread (or process) on the same or different data. Spreading
processing tasks along different threads must be carefully designed in order to
avoid bottlenecks (either in the processing or in memory access) that can block
the whole processing chain and prevent it from attaining real-time operation.
This section provides an overview of the underlying key concepts and task
scheduling strategy implemented in GNSS-SDR.


### Theoretical foundations: Kahn's process networks

The approach described hereafter is based on
[Gilles Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Kahn)'s formal, mathematical
representation of process networks[^Kahn74] and his efforts to define a language
based on a clear semantics of process interaction which facilitates
well-structured programming of dynamically evolving networks of
processes[^Kahn77].

A [Kahn process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks) describes
a model of computation where processes are connected by communication channels
to form a network. Processes produce data elements or tokens and send them along
a communication channel where they are consumed by the waiting destination
process. Communication channels are the only method processes may use to
exchange information. Kahn requires the execution of a process to be suspended
when it attempts to get data from an empty input channel. A process may not, for
example, test input for the presence or absence of data. At any given point, a
process can be either enabled or blocked waiting for data on only one of its
input channels: it cannot wait for data from more than one channel. Systems that
obey Kahn's mathematical model are determinate: the history of tokens produced
on the communication channels does not depend on the execution order[^Kahn74].
With a proper scheduling policy, it is possible to implement software-defined
radio process networks holding two key properties:

* **Non-termination:** understood as an infinite running flow graph process
  without deadlocks situations, and
* **Strictly bounded:** the number of data elements buffered on the
  communication channels remains bounded for all possible execution orders.

An analysis of such process networks scheduling was provided in Parks' PhD
Thesis[^Parks95].

**Idea to take home:** Software-defined radios can be represented as a flow
graph of nodes. Each node represents a signal processing block, whereas links
between nodes represent a flow of data. The concept of a flow graph can be
viewed as an acyclic directional graph (_i.e._, with no closed cycles) with
one or more source blocks (to insert samples into the flow graph), one or more
sink blocks (to terminate or export samples from the flow graph), and any
signal processing blocks in between.

An extremely simple flow graph would look like this:

and another more complex example that already should be familiar to you could be
as:

_Typical GNSS-SDR flow graph._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

### Implementation: GNU Radio

An actual implementation of these concepts is found in [GNU
Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/), a free and open-source framework for
software-defined radio applications. In addition to offering an extensive
assortment of signal processing blocks (filters, synchronization elements,
demodulators, decoders, and much more), GNU Radio also provides an
implementation of a runtime scheduler meeting the requirements described above.
This allows developers to focus on the implementation of the actual signal
processing, instead of worrying about how to embed such processes in an
efficient processing chain.

**Idea to take home:** By adopting GNU Radio's signal processing framework,
GNSS-SDR bases its software architecture in a well-established,
highly-efficient design and an extensively proven implementation.
{:.notice--info}

The diagram of a processing block (that is, of a given node in the flow graph),
as implemented by the GNU Radio framework, is shown below:

![GNU Radio block]({{ "/assets/images/gnuradio-block.png" | relative_url }}){: .align-center .invert-colors}
_Diagram of a signal processing block, as implemented by GNU Radio. Each block
has a completely independent scheduler running in its own execution thread and
an asynchronous messaging system for communication with other upstream and
downstream blocks. The actual signal processing is performed in the `work()`
method. Figure adapted from
[these Johnathan Corgan's slides](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543ae9afe4b0c3b808d72acd/t/55de1259e4b01e5c160764cf/1440617049937/5.+corgan_johnathan-scheduler+2015-08-25.pdf)._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Each block can have an arbitrary number of input and output _ports_ for data and
for asynchronous message passing with other blocks in the flow graph. In all
software applications based on the GNU Radio framework, the underlying process
scheduler passes items (i.e., units of data) from sources to sinks. For each
block, the number of items it can process in a single iteration is dependent on
how much space it has in its output buffer(s) and how many items are available
on the input buffer(s). The larger that number is, the better in terms of
efficiency (since the majority of the processing time is taken up with
processing samples), but also the larger the latency that will be introduced by
that block. On the contrary, the smaller the number of items per iteration, the
larger the overhead that will be introduced by the scheduler.


Thus, there are some constraints and requirements in terms of the number of
available items in the input buffers, and in the available space in the output
buffer in order to make all the processing chain efficient. In GNU Radio, each
block has a runtime scheduler that dynamically performs all those computations,
using algorithms that attempt to optimize throughput, implementing a process
network scheduling that fulfills the requirements described in Parks' PhD
Thesis[^Parks95]. A detailed description of the GNU Radio internal scheduler
implementation (memory management, requirement computations, and other related
algorithms and parameters) can be found in
[these Tom Rondeau's slides](https://static.squarespace.com/static/543ae9afe4b0c3b808d72acd/543aee1fe4b09162d0863397/543aee20e4b09162d0863578/1380223973117/gr_scheduler_overview.pdf).

**Idea to take home:** In this approach, each processing block executes in its
own thread, trying to process data from their income buffer(s) as fast as they
can, regardless of the input data rate. An underlying runtime scheduler is in
charge of managing the flow of data through the flow graph from source(s) to
sink(s).
{: .notice--info}

Under this scheme, software-defined signal processing blocks read the available
samples in their input memory buffer(s), process them as fast as they can, and
place the result in the corresponding output memory buffer(s), each of them
being executed in its own, independent thread. This strategy results in a
software receiver that always attempts to process the input signal at the
maximum processing capacity, since each block in the flow graph runs as fast as
the processor, data flow and buffer space allow for, regardless of its input
data rate. Achieving real-time is _only_ a matter of executing the receiver's
full processing chain in a processing system powerful enough to sustain the
required processing load, but it does not prevent from executing exactly the
same process at a slower pace, for example, by reading samples from a file in a
less powerful platform.

## Software architecture in GNSS-SDR

After defining some basic notation, this section describes a software design
based on [object-oriented
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) concepts
that allows for the efficient implementation of software-defined GNSS receivers.

### Notation

The notation is as follows: we use a very simplified version of the Unified
Modeling Language
([UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)), a standardized
general-purpose modeling language in the field of object-oriented software
engineering. On this page, classes are described as rectangles with two
sections: the top section for the name of the class, and the bottom section for
the methods of the class.


A dashed arrow from `ClassA` to `ClassB` represents the dependency relationship.
This relationship simply means that `ClassA` somehow depends upon `ClassB`. In
C++ this almost always results in an `#include`.

![Class dependency]({{ "/assets/images/dependency.png" | relative_url }}){:height="300px" width="300px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
_`ClassA` depends on `ClassB`._
{: style="text-align: center;"}


Inheritance models _is a_ and _is like_ relationships, enabling you to reuse
existing data and code easily. When `ClassB` inherits from `ClassA`, we say that
`ClassB` is the subclass of `ClassA`, and `ClassA` is the superclass (or parent
class) of `ClassB`. The UML modeling notation for inheritance is a line with a
closed arrowhead pointing from the subclass to the superclass.

![Class inheritance]({{ "/assets/images/inheritance.png" | relative_url }}){:width="150px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
_`ClassA` inherits from `ClassB`._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

### Class hierarchy overview

A key aspect of an object-oriented software design is how classes relate to each
other. In the GNU Radio framework,
[`gr::basic_block`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gnuradio-runtime/include/gnuradio/basic_block.h)
is the abstract base class for all signal processing blocks, a bare abstraction
of an entity that has a name and a set of inputs and outputs. It is never
instantiated directly; rather, this is the abstract parent class of both
[`gr::hier_block2`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gnuradio-runtime/include/gnuradio/hier_block2.h),
which is a recursive container that adds or removes processing or hierarchical
blocks to the internal graph,  and
[`gr::block`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gnuradio-runtime/include/gnuradio/block.h),
which is the abstract base class for all the processing blocks. A signal
processing flow is constructed by creating a tree of hierarchical blocks, which
at any level may also contain terminal nodes that actually implement signal
processing functions:

![Class hierarchy overview]({{ "/assets/images/class-hierarchy-sp.png" | relative_url }}){:width="500px"}{: .align-center .invert-colors}
_GNU Radio's class hierarchy._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

The class
[`gr::top_block`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gnuradio-runtime/include/gnuradio/top_block.h)
is the top-level hierarchical block representing a flow graph. It defines GNU
Radio runtime functions used during the execution of the program: `run()`,
`start()`, `stop()`, `wait()`, etc. It is used for defining the receiver
flow graph (that is, the interconnections within all the required blocks)
according to the configuration (more on that in the description of the [Control
Plane]({{"/docs/control-plane/" | relative_url }})).

The class called
[`GNSSBlockInterface`](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/src/core/interfaces/gnss_block_interface.h)
is the common interface for all the GNSS-SDR modules. It defines pure
**virtual** methods, that are required to be implemented by a derived class.

![Block interface]({{ "/assets/images/block-interface.png" | relative_url }}){: .align-center .invert-colors}
_Block interface for all Signal Processing blocks._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

**Definition:** Classes containing pure virtual methods are termed _abstract_;
they cannot be instantiated directly, and a subclass of an abstract class can
only be instantiated directly if all inherited pure virtual methods have been
implemented by that class or a parent class.
{: .notice--info}

Subclassing
[`GNSSBlockInterface`](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/src/core/interfaces/gnss_block_interface.h),
we defined interfaces for the receiver's processing blocks. This hierarchy,
shown in the figure below, provides a way to define an arbitrary number of
algorithms and implementations for each processing block, which will be
instantiated according to the configuration. This strategy defines multiple
implementations sharing a common interface, achieving the objective of
decoupling interfaces from implementations: it defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Hence, we let the
algorithm vary independently of the program that uses it.


![Block hierarchy]({{ "/assets/images/block-hierarchy.png" | relative_url }}){: .align-center .invert-colors}
_Class hierarchy for the Signal Processing Plane._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

This design pattern allows for an infinite number of algorithms and
implementations for each block. For instance, defining a new algorithm for
signal acquisition requires an _adapter_ ensuring it meets a minimal
[AcquisitionInterface](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/src/core/interfaces/acquisition_interface.h),
and the actual implementation in form of GNU Radio processing block (that is,
inheriting from
[`gr::block`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gnuradio-runtime/include/gnuradio/block.h)).

**Example:** An available implementation of an Acquisition block is called
[`GPS_L1_CA_PCPS_Acquisition`]({{
"/docs/sp-blocks/acquisition/#implementation-gps_l1_ca_pcps_acquisition" |
relative_url }}). Like any other Acquisition block, it has an adapter that
inherits from
[AcquisitionInterface](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/src/core/interfaces/acquisition_interface.h)
and the corresponding GNU Radio block inheriting from
[`gr::block`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gnuradio-runtime/include/gnuradio/block.h)
and implementing the actual processing. You can take a look at the source code:

* Adapter interface: [gnss-sdr/src/algorithms/acquisition/adapters/gps_l1_ca_pcps_acquisition.h](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/src/algorithms/acquisition/adapters/gps_l1_ca_pcps_acquisition.h)
* Adapter implementation: [gnss-sdr/src/algorithms/acquisition/adapters/gps_l1_ca_pcps_acquisition.cc](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/src/algorithms/acquisition/adapters/gps_l1_ca_pcps_acquisition.cc)

* Processing block implementation: [gnss-sdr/src/algorithms/acquisition/gnuradio_blocks/pcps_acquisition.cc](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/src/algorithms/acquisition/gnuradio_blocks/pcps_acquisition.cc)

### General class hierarchy for GNSS-SDR

The following figure summarizes the general class hierarchy for GNSS-SDR and its
relation to the GNU Radio framework:

![Class hierarchy overview]({{ "/assets/images/class-hierarchy-general.png" | relative_url }}){: .align-center .invert-colors}
_Overview of class hierarchy in GNSS-SDR and its relation to GNU Radio._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Up to this point, we have described a software design that accounts both for
efficiency and scalability. Modeling the GNSS receiver as a flow graph of
processing nodes with a source block delivering signal samples, a network of
nodes reading from their input buffer(s) and writing the output at their outputs
buffer(s), and a sink block, efficient process scheduling strategies can be put
in place. Then, we have proposed a software architecture that builds upon the
GNU Radio framework and defines interfaces for the key GNSS processing blocks.
In addition, following this approach, we can define an unlimited number of
implementations for each of the key GNSS signal processing blocks, all of them
inheriting the underlying design and thus being easily reusable. For instance,
we can define Acquisition implementations for GPS L1 C/A signals, Galileo E1B,
and so on, and then use those blocks just as any other existing GNU Radio block,
thus benefiting from nice features such as their internal runtime scheduler or
the asynchronous message passing system. However, we still have not described
how those blocks are connected together, how the whole system is managed, or how
the user can configure those blocks in order to define a fully custom
software-defined GNSS receiver. Those are jobs of the
[Control Plane]({{"/docs/control-plane/" | relative_url }}).
