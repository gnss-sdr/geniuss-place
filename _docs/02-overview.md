![What is GNSS-SDR]({{ "/assets/images/what-is-gnss-sdr.png" | relative_url }}){: .align-center .invert-colors}

GNSS-SDR is an open-source project that implements a global navigation satellite
system software-defined receiver in C++. With GNSS-SDR, users can build a GNSS
software receiver by creating a graph where the nodes are signal processing
blocks and the lines represent the data flow between them. The software provides
an interface to different suitable RF front-ends and implements all the
receiver's chain up to the navigation solution. Its design allows any kind of
customization, including interchangeability of signal sources, signal processing
algorithms, interoperability with other systems, output formats, and offers
interfaces to all the intermediate signals, parameters, and variables.

The goal is to provide efficient and truly reusable code, easy to read and
maintain, with fewer bugs, and producing highly optimized executables in a
variety of hardware platforms and operating systems. In that sense, the
challenge consists of defining a gentle balance between the level of abstraction
and performance, addressing:

- Concurrency (take advantage of multicore processors).
- Efficiency (take advantage of the specific processor architecture).
- Performance (and how to measure it!).
- Portability (should live in a complex, dynamic ecosystem of operating systems
  and processor architectures).
- Ability to run in real-time or in post-processing (real-time is only for the
  chosen ones).
- Extendibility (easy addition and test of new algorithms and implementations).

The proposed software receiver runs in a common personal computer and provides
interfaces through USB and Ethernet buses to a variety of either commercially
available or custom-made RF front-ends, adapting the processing algorithms to
different sampling frequencies, intermediate frequencies, and sample
resolutions. It also can process raw data samples stored in a file. The software
performs signal acquisition and tracking of the available satellite signals,
decodes the navigation message, and computes the observables needed by
positioning algorithms, which ultimately compute the navigation solution. It is
designed to facilitate the inclusion of new signal processing techniques,
offering an easy way to measure their impact on the overall receiver
performance. Testing of all the processes is conducted both by the systematic
functional validation of every single software block and by experimental
validation of the complete receiver using both real and synthetic signals. The
processing output can be stored in Receiver Independent Exchange Format
([RINEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX)), used by most geodetic processing
software for GNSS, or transmitted as RTCM 3.2 messages through a TCP/IP server
in real-time. Navigation results are stored in
[KML](https://www.ogc.org/standards/kml/) and
[GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) formats.

A GNSS software receiver is a complex system, which description needs to be
addressed at different abstraction layers. Hereafter, we describe the software
architecture implemented in GNSS-SDR, which is based on
[GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org), a well-established framework that
provides the signal processing runtime and processing blocks to implement
software radio applications.

Frameworks are a special case of software libraries. They are reusable
abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined API, yet they contain some key
distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries: the overall
program's flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework,
and it can be extended by the user usually by selective overriding or
specialized by user code providing specific functionality. Software frameworks
aim to facilitate software development by allowing designers and programmers to
devote their time to meeting software requirements rather than dealing with the
more standard low-level details of providing a working system, thereby reducing
overall development time. GNSS-SDR proposes a software architecture that builds
upon the [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org) framework in order to implement a
GNSS software-defined receiver.

The view from ten thousand meters is as follows:

- **The Control Plane** is in charge of creating a _flow graph_ in which a
  sample stream goes through a network of connected signal processing blocks up
  to the position fix. The nature of a GNSS receiver imposes some requirements
  in the architecture design: since the composition of the received GNSS signals
  will change over time (initially, some satellites will be visible, and after a
  while, some satellites will not be visible anymore and new ones will show up),
  some channels will lose track of their signals and some new channels will have
  to be instantiated to process the new signals. This means that the receiver
  must be able to activate and deactivate the channels dynamically, and it also
  needs to detect these changes during runtime. Section [Control
  Plane]({{ "/docs/control-plane/" | relative_url }}) describes how this is
  implemented in GNSS-SDR.
- **The Signal Processing Plane**, consisting of a collection of blocks that
  actually implement digital signal processing algorithms. Efficiency is
  especially critical before and during correlations (the most complex operation
  in terms of processing load, but from which sample rate decreases three orders
  of magnitude), and even a modern multi-purpose processor must be properly
  programmed in order to attain real-time. Section [Signal Processing
  Blocks]({{ "/docs/sp-blocks/" | relative_url }}) describes actual signal
  processing implementations in GNSS-SDR.

Watching it more closely, GNSS-SDR is a C++ program. When running, it reads
samples from a _Signal Source_ (an abstract concept that can represent a radio
frequency front-end, or a file, or a combination of them) of GNSS signals, and
performs all the signal processing up to the computation of a position fix.

As in any C++ program, the `main` method is called at program startup, after
initialization of the non-local objects with static storage duration. It is the
designated entry point to a program that is executed in a hosted environment
(that is, with an operating system). An excerpt of such `main` method (its
actual implementation is at
[gnss-sdr/src/main/main.cc](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/blob/main/src/main/main.cc))
is as follows:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    // Parse command line flags
    gflags::ParseCommandLineFlags(&argc, &argv, true);

    // Say hello
    std::cout << "Initializing GNSS-SDR v" << GNSS_SDR_VERSION
              << " ... Please wait.\n";

    // Logging library initialization
    google::InitGoogleLogging(argv[0]);

    // Smart pointer to a ControlThread object
    auto control_thread = std::make_unique<ControlThread>();

    // record startup time
    std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock> start, end;
    start = std::chrono::system_clock::now();

    // run the software receiver until it stops
    try
    {
        control_thread->run();
    }
    catch( ... )
    {
        // ...
    }

    // report the elapsed time
    end = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> elapsed_seconds = end - start;
    std::cout << "Total GNSS-SDR run time: "
              << elapsed_seconds.count()
              << " [seconds]\n";

    // Say goodbye
    gflags::ShutDownCommandLineFlags();
    std::cout << "GNSS-SDR program ended.\n";
    return 0;
}
```

GNSS-SDR's `main` method processes the command-line flags, if any, provided by
the user, and initializes the logging library. Then, it records the starting
time and instantiates a smart pointer to a `ControlThread` object. Its
constructor reads the configuration file, creates a control queue, and creates a
flow graph according to the configuration. Then, the program's main method calls
the `run()` method of the instantiated object, an action that connects the flow
graph and starts running it. After that, and until a `stop` message generated by
some processing block is received, it reads control messages sent by the
receiver's modules through a safe-thread queue and processes them. Finally, when
a `stop` message is actually received, the main method reports the execution
time, does some cleanup, and exits the program. The destructor of the
`ControlThread` object, which deallocates memory, is automatically executed at
the end of the method.

Hence, all the magic happens when we call the `run()` method of an instantiation
of a `ControlThread` object. If you are impatient to see what this method does,
you can jump to the [Control Plane]({{ "/docs/control-plane/" | relative_url }})
section. Before that, however, we highly recommend going through the
[Fundamentals]({{ "/docs/fundamentals/" | relative_url }}) section, which
describes GNSS-SDR's internal software architecture and underlying key concepts.
