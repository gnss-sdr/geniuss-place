Openness is a relative characteristic that refers to the degree to which
something is accessible to view, modify and use. From a social perspective,
openness is a core characteristic of an infrastructure that conveys and
reinforces sharing, reciprocity, collaboration, tolerance, equality, justice,
and freedom.

According to Tapscott[^Tapscott13], openness is based on four fundamental
principles:

* **Collaboration**: The boundaries of organizations are becoming more porous.
* **Transparency**: This is about the communication of pertinent information to
  stakeholders of organizations: employees, customers, business partners,
  shareholders, and so on. You also need to have values in order to build trust
  upon them.
* **Sharing**: This is about giving up assets, intellectual property. We need to
  reinvent the whole model of scientific research. There is a need to place
  assets in a common, a need to share pre-competitive research.
* **Empowerment**: Knowledge and intelligence is power. As it becomes more
  distributed, there is a distribution, decentralization, and disaggregation of
  power.


The application of openness, as implied by various accessibility features, to a
growing number of central ubiquitous practices that drive the human enterprise,
has turned into a _megatrend_ that has been labeled "_the Rise of
Open-X_"[^Avital11]. Open-X has materialized in various configurations that can
be classified according to three archetypes: open source, open design and open
innovation.

The value proposition and thrust of **[Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)** resides
in distributed development processes that emphasize the _modification-related_
capabilities of openness. Everyone can freely access the source code, and can
modify and redistribute it under the same terms, thus nourishing continuous
cycles of improvement, adaptation, and extension in a distributed fashion. For
more details, please check out [this overview on Open-Source Software
Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses), which describes the most popular
open-source licenses currently available and provides further reading.

The value proposition and thrust of **[Open
Design](https://github.com/OpenDesign-WorkingGroup/Open-Design-Definition)**
resides in distributed manufacturing processes that emphasize the _use-related_
capabilities of openness.  It is a trend that is a product of current
technological development, specifically the easy access to computer-aided
production tools and the Internet.

> Open Design is a design artifact project whose source documentation is made
publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, prototype
and sell the artifact based on that design. The artifact's source, the design
documentation from which it is made, is available in the preferred format for
making modifications to it.

The value proposition and thrust of **[Open
Innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation)** resides in
distributed knowledge processes that emphasize the _view-related_ capabilities
of openness. According to open innovation, industry leaders make the best use of
internal and external ideas to develop better business models.

## Indicators of Openness

It follows a list of possible openness indicators for a software-defined GNSS
receiver:

* Software released under a [free and open-source license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
  - Allowing derivative works under the same license terms.
  - Allowing its commercial usage.
  - Dual licensing schemes.

* Availability of a technical report on algorithms and parameters used for:
  - Signal conditioning (possible digital down-conversion, filtering,
    decimation, sample format).
  - Signal acquisition.
  - Signal tracking.
  - Demodulation and decoding of the navigation message.
  - PVT computation.

* In the case of assisted / differential GNSS, reporting of the accessibility of
  the assistance / differential sources and nature of the delivered data.
