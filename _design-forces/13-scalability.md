Scalability refers to the ability of the software to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner, or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

## Indicators of Scalability

It follows a list of possible scalability indicators for a software-defined GNSS receiver:

* Quasi-linear acceleration with the number of processors available in the computing platform.
* Arbitrarily scalable receiver's software architecture: unlimited addition of new GNSS signals and algorithms.
* Arbitrarily scalable configuration system.
* Maximum number of concurrent users.
