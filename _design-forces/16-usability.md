It refers to the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use.

## Indicators of Usability

It follows a list of possible usability indicators for a software-defined GNSS receiver:

* Availability of a (versioned) User Manual.
* Availability of a (versioned and documented) application programming interface (API).
* Availability of graphical user interface.
* Availability of accessibility mechanisms for users who experience disabilities.
* Availability of mechanisms for remote operation.
* Availability of interfaces with other programming languages.
* Availability of user documentation: tutorials, detailed _howtos_, user stories, etc.


For the project, product or service in which the software receiver has a role:

* Website of project, product or service.
* Availability of professional help desk support services.
* Availability of communication channels with other users and the development team.
  - Public mailing list.
  - Presence in public IRC channels.
  - Presence in social networks.


For the computing platform executing the software receiver:

* For physical devices:
  - Computer form factor, shape, size and weight.
  - Power consumption / battery autonomy.
  - Degrees of protection from solid objects and liquids, given by the [Ingress Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) rating system. Examples:
      * IP65: protection from dust and from low pressure jets of water in all directions. Limited water ingress permitted.
      * IP67: protection from dust and against the effects of immersion in water to depth between 15 cm and 1 meter.
  - Temperature / humidity / vibration operative ranges.


* For cloud--based services:
  - Input/output data throughput requirements.
  - Computational and memory bandwidth requirements.
  - Connection to third parties in case of assisted or differential GNSS.
