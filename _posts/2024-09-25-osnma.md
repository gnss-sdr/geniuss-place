GNSS signal spoofing has become a frequent and concerning issue, particularly in regions
experiencing military conflicts. This phenomenon can be monitored through various online
platforms that use [ADS-B data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast)
to detect and display, in near-real time, instances of aircraft being
[jammed](http://gpsjam.org) or [spoofed](https://spoofing.skai-data-services.com)
worldwide.  In such scenarios, GNSS signal authentication is crucial for mitigating the
effects of spoofing. This can be achieved by detecting spoofed signals at various stages
of the signal processing chain, depending on the service provided by the system operator
and the userâ€™s receiver. If spoofed signals are detected, the receiver can respond by
either issuing appropriate warnings to the user or excluding non-authenticated satellite
signals from the computation of Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) solutions.

Galileo, the European GNSS, is currently testing its Open Service Navigation
Message Authentication (OSNMA) service. OSNMA is designed to provide a secure,
spoof-proof communication channel between satellites and receivers. This service
transmits authentication data within the Galileo E1 I/NAV messages, alongside
the navigation data used by receivers to compute PVT solutions. By incorporating
OSNMA, the resilience of GNSS receivers to spoofing attacks is significantly
enhanced, since they can detect spoofed signals and act upon that event.

OSNMA makes use of different keys from a single one-way chain shared by the
Galileo satellites through a Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication
(TESLA) protocol.[^Perrig03]

The main idea of the TESLA protocol is that the sender appends a message
authentication code (MAC) to each data packet, computed using a key $$ K $$
known only to the sender. The receiver buffers the received packet without being
able to authenticate it immediately. Shortly afterward, the sender discloses
$$ K $$, allowing the receiver to authenticate the packet.
{: .notice--info}

The OSNMA service takes a similar approach: in each I/NAV navigation data
subframe of the [Galileo E1 OS
signal]({{ "/docs/tutorials/gnss-signals/#galileo-e1" | relative_url }}) (that
is, every 30 seconds), a subset of satellites insert predefined sequences of
truncated message authentication codes, which are computed with an undisclosed
key $$ K_{N} $$ and the data to be later authenticated. These truncated message
authentication codes are known as *tags*, and are generally defined as:

$$
\text{tag} = \textit{trunc} \left( L, \textit{mac} \left( \textit{data},
\textit{key} \right) \right)~,
$$

where $$ \textit{trunc} \left( L, I \right) $$ is the truncation function
retaining the $$ L $$ most significant bits (MSB) of the input $$ I $$, and
$$ \textit{mac} \left( m, K \right) $$ is the MAC function used for the current
TESLA key chain, applied to message $$ m $$ and with key $$ K $$. The key 
$$ K_{N} $$ remains unknown to the receiver at the reception time. In the next
subframe (or ten subframes later in some cases), satellites send the key
$$ K_{N} $$ along with the means to verify its authenticity. The receiver can then
compute the tags with the previously received data and the newly received key.
If they match the received associated tags, the data can be declared
authenticated, and hence the GNSS products derived from them, such as Position,
Velocity, and Time. This authentication mechanism can refer to the navigation
data broadcast by any of the Galileo satellites, even if they are not in the
subset broadcasting OSNMA data.

The OSNMA data is broadcast across multiple Galileo satellites, with messages
sliced and sent in no predefined order, requiring the receiver to combine the
received data from several satellites in order to effectively implement the
service. Consequently, the proposed software architecture includes a processing
block that asynchronously collects the OSNMA data received from all available
Galileo E1 OS processing channels. This block then combines and processes the
OSNMA data, and asynchronously transmits the list of authenticated satellites to
the PVT computation block, which, based on user configuration, either warns the
user or excludes unauthenticated satellites from the PVT solution computation.

From the user perspective, the required steps involve registering and logging on
the [European GNSS Service Centre website](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/) to
download the necessary OSNMA Public Key and Merkle Tree root files. The required
files are under GSC Products > OSNMA_Publickey (the required file ends with
`.crt`, at the time of writing this note it is named
`OSNMA_PublicKey_20240115100000_newPKID_1.crt`) and GSC Products >
OSNMA_Merkletree (the required file ends with `.xml`, at the time of writing
this note it is named `OSNMA_MerkleTree_20240115100000_newPKID_1.xml`). Once
downloaded, the user can set their paths in the GNSS-SDR configuration file:

```ini
GNSS-SDR.osnma_public_key=./OSNMA_PublicKey_20240115100000_newPKID_1.crt
GNSS-SDR.osnma_merkletree=./OSNMA_MerkleTree_20240115100000_newPKID_1.xml
```

The GNSS-SDR receiver can be configured with options such as OSNMA disabled,
enabled with warnings, or strict authenticated-only PVT fixes. By default, the
ONSMA operation in configured as enabled with warnings if there are channels
devoted to the Galileo E1 OS signal (named `1B` in GNSS-SDR terminology). This
can be disabled by setting:

```ini
GNSS-SDR.osnma_enable=false
```

The strict mode (that is, PVT fixes are computed exclusively from authenticated
signals) can be activated by setting:

```ini
GNSS-SDR.osnma_mode=strict
```

GNSS-SDR]({{ "/docs/sp-blocks/global-parameters/#open-service-navigation-message-authentication-osnma" | relative_url }})
for more information.

## Extraction of OSNMA data from signals in space

According to the Signal-In-Space Interface Control Document,[^OSNMA-ICD] the
Galileo OSNMA protocol data are transmitted within the odd pages of the nominal
E1-B I/NAV message. The bits are placed in previously reserved positions:

![OSNMA data]({{ "/assets/images/OSNMA_data.png" | relative_url }}){:width="500px"}{:
.align-center .invert-colors} _E1-B I/NAV Nominal Page with bits allocation
(from OSNMA SIS-ICD[^OSNMA-ICD])._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

OSNMA data are distributed only by a subset of the Galileo satellites. If a
satellite is not part of the above-mentioned subset, the I/NAV OSNMA message
will contain a 40-bit sequence of zeros.

The OSNMA field has the following structure:

![OSNMA message]({{ "/assets/images/OSNMA_msg.png" | relative_url }}){:width="200px"}{:
.align-center .invert-colors} _OSNMA data message (from OSNMA SIS-ICD[^OSNMA-ICD])._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

- **The HKROOT (header and root key) section** is an 8-bit portion of a 120 bits
  long message, which is transmitted once every 30 seconds, _i.e._ within each
  E1B I/NAV sub-frame. The HKROOT message begins always with an 8-bit NMA Header
  field, followed by a 112-bit Digital Signature Message (DSM) field, consisting
  of a DSM Header, followed by a DSM block:

  ![HKROOT message]({{ "/assets/images/HKROOT.png" | relative_url }}){:width="600px"}{:
  .align-center .invert-colors} _HKROOT Message (from OSNMA SIS-ICD [^OSNMA-ICD])._
  {: style="text-align: center;"}

  Several DSM blocks, transmitted through successive subframes, form a complete
  DSM. Different satellites can transmit different blocks of the same DSM at a
  given sub-frame.

  There are two different types of DSM:

  - DSM-PKR, providing the Public Key for the verification of the root key of
    the TESLA chain. The Public Key in force, together with its ID and signature
    algorithm, is provided in the DSM-PKR message every 6 hours (starting at
    00:00 GST, 06:00 GST, 12:00 GST and 18:00 GST) for a period of 30 minutes.
    If the Public Key has not been provided by the user in the
    `GNSS-SDR.osnma_public_key` configuration parameter, the receiver will
    retrieve it from the signals in space.
  - DSM-KROOT, providing a digitally signed root key for the TESLA chain in
    force, or the one of the next chain, and the means to authenticate those
    keys using the Public Key in force.

- **The MACK (message authentication code and key) section** is a 32-bit portion
  of a 480 bits long message, which is transmitted once every 30 seconds, _i.e._
  within each E1-B I/NAV sub-frame. Each MACK message contains several truncated
  Message Authentication Codes, or tags, with specific information data
  associated (Tag-Info), and a TESLA key.

  ![MACK message]({{ "/assets/images/MACK.png" | relative_url }}){:width="300px"}{:
  .align-center .invert-colors} _MACK Message (from OSNMA SIS-ICD[^OSNMA-ICD])._
  {: style="text-align: center;"}

Therefore, a 120-bit HKROOT message and a 480-bit MACK message are transmitted
every 30 seconds. Both HKROOT and MACK messages are split into 15 portions of
equal size (8 or 32 bits) and transmitted within each 40-bit OSNMA data message.

In OSNMA, the MAC algorithm used to authenticate the _plain text_ navigation
message can be either HMAC-SHA-256[^FIPS-198-1] or CMAC-AES[^ISO-9797-1], the
former being used in the Testing phase. The TESLA keys belong to a chain that
begins with a random seed key $$ K_N $$, known only to the sender (in this case,
the OSNMA provider), and ends with a root key $$ K_0 $$ that is public and 
certified through the DSM-KROOT messages. A TESLA key $$ K_N $$ can be verified
against the root key $$ K_0 $$ by computing $$ F^N(K_N) $$
and comparing the result with $$ K_0 $$. In OSNMA, the function $$ F(\cdot) $$
is defined in the ICD[^OSNMA-ICD].

![TESLA key chain]({{ "/assets/images/TESLA_chain.png" | relative_url }}){:width="600px"}{:
.align-center .invert-colors} _TESLA key chain, where $$ K_{n} = F(K_{n+1}) $$._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

The TESLA root key $$ K_{0} $$ retrieved from the DSM-KROOT message is verified
using an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)[^FIPS-186-5], by
signing the data with a private key known only to the OSNMA provider and
verifying it at the receiver with a public cryptographic key. That ECDSA Public
Key can be either retrieved from the
[European GNSS Service Centre website](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/) and passed to
GNSS-SDR via the `GNSS-SDR.osnma_public_key` configuration parameter, or from
the Signal in Space broadcasted by Galileo satellites. The Public Key in force,
together with its ID and signature algorithm, is provided in the DSM-PKR message
every 6 hours for a period of 30 minutes, mixed with other DSM-KROOT messages.
The receiver must authenticate this reception against a
[Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) root $$ x_{4, 0} $$
(see figure below), using the same hashing algorithm that was employed for tree
generation, currently SHA-256[^FIPS-180-4]. In the future, the system may adopt
SHA3-256[^FIPS-202].

![OSNMA Merkle Tree]({{ "/assets/images/MerkleTree.png" | relative_url }}){:width="600px"}{:
.align-center .invert-colors} _OSNMA Merkle Tree (from OSNMA SIS-ICD[^OSNMA-ICD])._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Some nodes of the Merkle Tree (among them, the root node $$ x_{4, 0} $$) can be
retrieved from the
[European GNSS Service Centre website](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/) and passed to
GNSS-SDR via the `GNSS-SDR.osnma_merkletree` configuration parameter. Note that
a renewal of the Merkle tree is expected to take place very rarely, typically
after more than 10 years, so GNSS-SDR already comes with pre-loaded values that
are used in the case that `GNSS-SDR.osnma_merkletree` is not defined.

## Processing of the authentication material

The authentication concept is based on two main principles:

- The use of different keys from a single one-way chain shared by the Galileo
  satellites through a Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication
  (TESLA) protocol.

- The possibility to authenticate satellites which do not transmit OSNMA with
  the data retrieved from satellites transmitting OSNMA, referred to as
  cross-authentication.

From a receiver perspective, the process of the OSNMA data can be described at a
high level by the following steps:

- The receiver retrieves the navigation data and the corresponding OSNMA data
  (tag, TESLA chain key and TESLA root key). The tag authenticates the
  navigation data and is received before its associated TESLA chain key.
- The TESLA root key is authenticated by means of its digital signature using a
  Public Key that must be available at the receiver.
- The receiver authenticates the TESLA chain key with the TESLA root key or with
  a previously authenticated key from the TESLA chain.
- The receiver re-generates locally the tag with the verified TESLA chain key
  and the data, and checks whether it coincides with the received tag.

If the result of all these steps is successful, the user can consider the
navigation data as authentic. [^OSNMA-RG]

![OSNMA Processing]({{ "/assets/images/OSNMA_processing.png" | relative_url }}){:width="500px"}{:
.align-center} _OSNMA processing logic (from the OSNMA Receiver Guidelines[^OSNMA-RG])._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

OSNMA defines different Authentication Data & Key Delay (ADKD) types. Each type
authenticates different parts of the I/NAV data transmitted by satellites which
is used to generate the associated tag. A tag is defined as a truncated Message
Authentication Code. The currently defined types (others could be defined in
future versions of the ICD) are:

- **Tag ADKD=0 - Galileo I/NAV Ephemeris, Clock and Status:** The tag
  authenticates I/NAV data transmitted in the previous I/NAV sub-frame. The data
  authenticated are Word Types 1 to 5, retrieved from either E1-B or E5b-I,
  including: IODnav, Ephemeris, SISA(E1,E5b), SVID, Clock correction,
  Ionospheric correction, BGDs, HS and DVS flags.

- **Tag ADKD=4 - Galileo I/NAV Timing Parameters:** The tag authenticates the
  I/NAV data from the Word Type 6 transmitted one sub-frame earlier and the Word
  Type 10, transmitted one or two subframes earlier (retrieved from E1-B only).
  The data authenticated include GST-UTC conversion parameters (Word Type 6)
  and GST-GPS conversion parameters (Word Type 10).

- **Tag ADKD=12 - Slow MAC - Galileo I/NAV Ephemeris, Clock and Status:** The
  tag is generated as per ADKD=0 definition but using a key that is published
  with an additional 10 sub-frames delay (5 minutes).

The possible sequences of transmitted tags (either for self-authentication or
cross-authentication of satellite data) are predefined in a look-up table. In
those sequences, some slots are fixed, and others are flexible (not defined in
the look-up table) and its content definition (which is found in the Tag-Info
data) needs to be authenticated through the corresponding TESLA key.

The truncated Message Authentication Codes, or tags, with specific information
data associated (Tag-Info), and the TESLA key are conveyed in the MACK messages
described above. Looking into their structure in more detail, there is a MACK
header defined as:

![MACK header]({{ "/assets/images/MACK_header.png" | relative_url }}){:width="200px"}{:
.align-center .invert-colors} _MACK message header (from OSNMA SIS-ICD[^OSNMA-ICD])._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

The $$ \text{Tag}\_{0} $$ field contains a tag obtained by truncating a MAC of
type ADKD=0 for the satellite transmitting the OSNMA data, and it is always the
first tag of the MACK message. THE MACSEQ field allows the receiver to
authenticate the Tag-Info field for the tags whose ADKD type is identified as
flexible, and the Data Cut-Off Point (COP) indicates the maximum time lag
between the tag and the navigation data it authenticates.

The next field in the MACK message is Tags&Info, defined as a sequence of tags
and their corresponding Tag-Info data:

![MACK Tags&Info]({{ "/assets/images/MACK_tags_info.png" | relative_url }}){:width="400px"}{:
.align-center .invert-colors} _MACK message's Tags&Info field (from OSNMA SIS-ICD [^OSNMA-ICD])._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

The tags are obtained by generating a certain MAC, following the specific
information within the Tag-Info field, and then truncating it (starting from the
MSB) to the length defined by the Tag Size field within the DSM-KROOT of the
chain in force.

![MACK Tag-Info]({{ "/assets/images/MACK_tag_info.png" | relative_url }}){:width="250px"}{:
.align-center .invert-colors} _MACK message's Tag-Info field (from OSNMA SIS-ICD
[^OSNMA-ICD]), where the $$ \text{PRN}\_{D} $$ field identifies the satellite
transmitting the navigation data which is authenticated by the tag._
{: style="text-align: center;"}

A possible example of received tag sequence, spanning two MACK messages, is:

```
00S, FLX, 04S, FLX, 12S, 00E, 00S, FLX, 00E, 12S, 00E, 12E
```
{: class="no-copy"}

where the first 2 characters define the ADKD and the last character means `S`
for self-authentication, or `E` for Galileo cross-authentication. For example,
`12S` means ADKD=12, self-authentication; and `00E` means ADKD=0, Galileo
cross-authentication. The slots marked as `FLX` are flexible, as they are not
fixed in the look-up table, and their Tag-Info data required to generate them
are authenticated via the MACSEQ field.

The OSNMA-equipped receiver must store these sequences of tags. In the next
sub-frame (or ten sub-frames later for ADKD=12), it will receive the TESLA key
that allows it to compute the MAC and, consequently, the tags. The receiver can
then compare the computed tags to the received sequence. If they match, the
received data can be declared authenticated.

## Implementation of cryptographic functions in GNSS-SDR

The OSNMA protocol requires two secure hash standards (SHA-256 and SHA3-256),
two message authentication code functions (HMAC-SHA-256 and CMAC-AES) for tag
verification, and two Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithms (ECDSA P-256
and ECDSA P-521) for verifying the TESLA root key, with only one option from
each category used at a time. During the testing phase, only SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-256,
and ECDSA P-256 are employed, but the others may be utilized in the future.

Implementing cryptographic functions from scratch in C++ is often unnecessary and
inefficient. Instead, leveraging well-known, reliable, and actively maintained
open-source libraries ensures more robust and secure implementations. These
libraries undergo continuous testing and updates, benefiting from scrutiny by a
large, diverse user base. In the GNSS-SDR implementation, the goal was to enable
the OSNMA service across the widest possible range of hardware and software
environments, covering diverse setups such as embedded SoC/FPGA-based platforms,
the Raspberry Pi 5, older or less powerful x86-64-based personal computers, and
even Apple's cutting-edge M3 silicon processors running in a macOS environment.
The required open-source dependency options, which are transparent to the user
and automatically picked up by the build configuration system upon availability,
are:

- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
  toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication. Versions 1.x
  were published under a dual-license scheme that was incompatible with the GPLv3.0
  license, preventing the library from being a mandatory dependency for GNSS-SDR in
  most GNU/Linux distributions. OpenSSL 1.1.1, released on September 11, 2018, had
  already implemented all the cryptographic functions required by the OSNMA protocol.
  The licensing issue was resolved in OpenSSL version 3.0.0, which transitioned to
  the Apache License 2.0, fully compatible with GPLv3.0. Released on September 7,
  2021, OpenSSL 3.0.0 and its subsequent updates support the cryptographic functions
  required by OSNMA and have been incorporated into major GNU/Linux distributions
  released since 2022. For instance, in Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions, it can be
  installed with `sudo apt install libssl-dev`.

- [GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org/) is used as a fallback if OpenSSL is not found on
  the host system when building GNSS-SDR. You can force linking against GnuTLS even if
  OpenSSL is installed by using the `-DENABLE_GNUTLS=ON`
  [configuration option]({{ "/docs/tutorials/configuration-options-building-time/#binary-portability-and-packaging-options" | relative_url }}).
  This Transport Layer Security library, published under the GNU Lesser General Public
  License (LGPL), is available even in older GNU/Linux distributions. However, some
  operating systems may omit the optional (but necessary) SSL module. For instance,
  in Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions, it can be installed with
  `sudo apt install libgnutls-openssl-dev`. This library has implemented all the
  cryptographic functions required by OSNMA since version 3.6.13, released on April
  24, 2020.

## Usage of OSNMA data in GNSS-SDR

To use the OSNMA service in GNSS-SDR, users need to perform the following steps:

1. Register on the
   [Galileo Service Center (GSC) website](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/).
2. Download the public key and Merkle Tree files (`.crt` and `.xml` formats,
   respectively).
3. Specify their locations in the GNSS-SDR configuration file using the
   `GNSS-SDR.osnma_public_key` and `GNSS-SDR.osnma_merkletree` configuration
   parameters.

If your configuration includes `1B` channels (Galileo E1 OS), the OSNMA service
will be enabled by default. In this mode, all OSNMA-related events will be
logged, and corresponding messages will be displayed in the terminal. If a
negative authentication occurs, warning messages will be shown, **but the
receiver will continue to operate normally**.

For PVT (Position, Velocity, and Time) solutions based solely on authenticated
signals, you can enable strict mode by setting `GNSS-SDR.osnma_mode=strict` in
your configuration file. In this mode, any non-authenticated signals will be
disregarded.

Please note that, in strict mode, the OSNMA protocol requires the receiver's
internal clock to be synchronized with the Galileo System Time, allowing a 
tolerance of Â±30 seconds. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the system
date and time on the computer running GNSS-SDR are set within this margin.
This mode can only be used when processing GNSS signals in real-time via a RF
front-end, but not in post-processing mode (that is, a signal source reading
from a file).

## Other open-source OSNMA implementations

Apart from the work presented in this page, there are other very interesting
open-source implementations of the OSNMA protocol:

- **[OSNMAlib](https://github.com/Algafix/OSNMA)** is an open-source Python
  library that can be used for research purposes or be integrated into existing
  receivers (among them, GNSS-SDR via the [UDP `NavDataMonitor`
  output]({{ "/docs/sp-blocks/telemetry-decoder/#retrieving-decoded-navigation-messages" | relative_url }}))
  and applications to incorporate navigation message authentication to the
  positioning process.[^Galan22] The authors have made relevant contributions to
  the OSNMA protocol itself,[^Fernandez16] and proposed techniques for
  shortening the Time To First Authenticated Fix.[^Galan24]

- **[galileo-osnma](https://github.com/daniestevez/galileo-osnma)** is a Rust
  implementation of the OSNMA protocol that can be used in some embedded
  microcontrollers.

- **[FGI-OSNMA](https://github.com/nlsfi/fgi-osnma)** is an open-source Python
  library implementing the OSNMA protocol, and it is delivered by the National
  Land Survey of Finland. At the moment it only supports the Septentrio Binary
  Format (SBF), though the SBF can be read from either a file, network socket,
  or serial port.

## Conclusions

The OSNMA service, in general, and the described GNSS-SDR integration, in
particular, represent significant steps forward in enhancing GNSS receiver
[reliability]({{ "/design-forces/reliability/" | relative_url }}) in scenarios
with potential spoofing attacks. The open-source nature of the presented
solutions allows for the early adoption of the OSNMA service and promotes its
continuous scrutiny, maintenance, discussion, and potential improvements.

Please note that OSNMA functionality is available starting from GNSS-SDR v0.0.20.
